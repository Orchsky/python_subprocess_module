Suprocess module:

1. Why subprocess module: It overcomes the limitation of OS module. In OS module command output cannot be saved. 
2. Linux/Unix running processes: ps aux, top/htop 
3. Don't use SHELL=True if really necesarry. It may lead to security leak. 
4. If Shell=False need to put command as LIST 
5. If Shell=True need to put command as String
